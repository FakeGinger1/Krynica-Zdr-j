    <h4>A little history.</h4>
    <h5>Medicinal Waters</h5>
    <p>
      Krynicas' location in the valley of four streams (the Kryniczanka,
      Palenica, Slotwinka and Czarny potok) as well as its altitude of 560 to
      720 metres, earned the town fame for its medicinal waters (fitting as
      “Zdrój” means mineral spring in Polish). The town's springs offer a
      variety of alkaline and acidic waters with high levels of trace elements
      and very distinct tastes and numerous health benefits. The first water
      analysis took place in 1788-1795 and in 1807 Krynica-Zdrój officially
      became a spa and to this days has many sanatoriums, mineral/mud baths and
      a water pump house

    <h5>Winter Sports</h5>
    <p>
      The town's reputation as a winter sports oasis can be attributed to its
      incredible mountain location with its ski resort on Jaworzyna Kryniczka
      reaching a peak of 1,114 metres. Winter sports tournaments have been
      hosted in the town since the interwar period, more recently the Winter
      World Polonia Games were hosted in 2018 and 2020.

    <h5>Architecture</h5>
    <p>
      Krynica is also dotted with brilliantly colourful, nineteenth-century
      wooden villas and houses. These were built after the town's increase in
      spa and sanatorium patients in the mid 1800s. The design of these villas'
      was inspired by the Swiss style of architecture at the time. Many of these
      buildings have been preserved allowing tourists to witness the beautifully
      intricate carvings and mouldings.

    <h5>Nikifor</h5>
    <p>
      Krynica is also home to famous naïve painter, Nikifor Krynicki
      (1895-1968), who painted upwards of 40,000 paintings on various surfaces
      ranging from cigarette cartons to sheets of paper. His paintings, most
      depicting the cityscape of Krynica-Zdrój, took inspiration from the
      architecture of orthodox churches and villas. In 1995, the town opened a
      museum in the painter's memory and later, in 2005 erected a statue of
      Nikifor which sits in a square looking out onto a small street named after
      him.
